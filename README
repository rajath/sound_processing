Can analayze a wave file of any sampling frquency and save a waveform in png format (in folder /png) with speech activity highlighted in red. Also saves a text file (in /txt folder) with details of speech length and processing time.

Just run it with the command:

python audio_analysis.py -i "inputfile.wav"
